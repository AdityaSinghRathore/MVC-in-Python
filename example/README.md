# MVC in Python

## Application execution
If you want to execute the application to see how it works, you have to download the database file that the app uses. This file is in <code>db/mvc.sql</code>. After that, it's necessary to load the file in a server (local or online) with support to MySQL database. I executed the app using a local server (as I use Windows, I used "Wampp" to make a local server, but if you use another operational system, there are other similar softwares, like Xampp [for Linux] or Mamp [for Mac]).
Furthermore the app use "mysql connector" library; if you don't have it, it's necessary install it.
